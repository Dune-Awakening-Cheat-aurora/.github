## 🚨 Cheat Smart: Stay Off the Radar

While the cheat uses stealth injection and smart hooks, you still need to **play it safe**:

* Don’t go full rage mode in populated areas
* Use lower FOV on aimbot and limit ESP distance
* Mix legit play with cheat-assisted actions
* Use burner accounts for testing mods

**The spice must flow**—but make sure it flows under the radar 😎
